# Machine learning web app using Flask
<!-- endhide -->

- In this project, we will create a machine learning web application. To do a beautiful one, you are free to choose the best model between all your previous projects, and apply your new **Flask** skills!  

> Don't forget to always be resourceful!

## 🌱  How to start this project

You will not be forking this time, please take some time to read these instructions:

1. Create a new repository based on a [machine learning project](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template/generate) by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template).
2. Open the recently created repository on Gitpod by using the [Gitpod button extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/).
3. Once Gitpod VSCode has finished opening, you start your project following the Instructions below.

## 🚛 How to deliver this project

Once you are finished deploying your flask app, make sure to commit your changes, push to your repository and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the web application link.

## 📝 Instructions

**Step 1:**

Now that you have learned what your final structure should look like, add the necessary files to the current project folder in order to have the correct structure, and edit the necessary ones.

**Step 2:**

Use the .pkl file (model) from the project of your preference to build a machine learning web application.
For example, if you are using the Titanic model, it should request certain passenger features and predict if that passenger would survive or not. 

**Step 3:**

Deploy your app to Heroku!

>Use your [Deploy model using Flask and Heroku](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-content/blob/master/07-4d-ml_deploy/deploy-model-using-flask-and-heroku.md) lesson to guide you on every step.
